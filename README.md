# This project is created by Sora, Xyz, Vxv and Yuan.
# In this project, we are committed to developing the visual processing component capable of recognizing the majority of content in a game of Landlord. This includes processing the information about the cards obtained through visual analysis. Subsequently, we will work on the AI component, which will analyze how to play using AI algorithms based on the processed card information. Finally, we will focus on the user interface (UI) for interaction with users.
